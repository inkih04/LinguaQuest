LinguaQuest is a small yet powerful application developed with Qt5 and C++ that helps users practice and improve their English vocabulary.
It allows the user to have five files with English and Spanish words that follow the next structure `car-coche;...`

## Changing the Vocabulary Files
You just have to remove one of the former files and add one of your own into the `vocabulario` folder.
The words in these files must follow the correct structure for the words `car-coche;...`

## Adding More Pictures
At the moment, only the file "vocabulario Para Fotos" has all the pictures to be able to play "Interpretaci√≥n imagenes", but you can add more pictures by adding the picture to the folder `imagenessVocabulario` with the name of the word in English.
